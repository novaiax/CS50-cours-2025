If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

To estimate whether a song feels sad, happy, or neutral, we can rely on the audio features available in songs.db, such as energy, tempo and loudness.
For excemple, songs with a hight tempo and hight energy could be charactherized as energetic.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The approach I proposed was limited because a sad song can still be fast or energetic.
This makes the results unreliable and may not reflect the listener’s actual preferences.

A better approach could involve using features likes speechiness or valence, which provide a clearer indication of the émotional of a song.
